                    <p>
                        Hi! I'm a photographer based in Bellevue, Washington. I am constantly inspired by the world around me and love capturing the unique beauty of each and every one of my subjects. Whether it's a family portrait, senior photo, or event, I strive to create images that are genuine and full of emotion. Regardless of the season, this time in your life deserves to be captured by something other than your iPhone.

                    <h2>Portraits:</h2>
                    <p>Are you looking for photos that capture your unique story? Do you want a laid-back, fun experience that focuses on connection + not perfection? Then you're in the right place. My goal as your photographer is to capture YOU. Your personality, your interests, what makes you different. I intend to show you the best version of you and help capture joyful, authentic, and timeless memories.</p>

                    <p>You may have heard the phrase, "The days are long, but the years are short." If you are here, you already know how true that statement is. With family photography, you can preserve each season of your family's life with timeless photos that can be passed down from generation. As your photographer, I strive to catch the moment, optimize the light, enhance the truth, and develop the clarity while exercising patience and kindness.</p>

                    <p>Taking on a more documentary style, I capture lifestyle and events with a high regard for joyful, authentic, and timeless imagery. Every project, every job is my next work of art. I look at each client's project as the next blank canvas. I am open to ideas, desires, yet confident enough to guide a process of finding what your needs are. I am delighted to custom tailor a package for your event or branding needs.</p>
